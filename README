# 3D Solar System Simulation

This project is an interactive **3D Solar System simulation** built with [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/). It visually represents the Sun and major planets, complete with realistic textures, orbital paths, and interactive controls.

---

## Features

- **Realistic 3D models** of the Sun and all major planets
- **Textured skybox** for a deep space effect
- **Accurate orbital paths** visualized as rings
- **Interactive controls** (rotate, zoom, pan) using OrbitControls
- **Play/Pause animation** with a floating button
- **Dynamic planet labels** that always face the camera
- **Saturn's iconic rings** rendered with multiple concentric meshes

**All texture images are located in the `img/` folder.**  
The skybox images are inside `img/skybox/`.

## Getting Started

> **Note:** This project is **not deployed online**. To run it locally, you must use a local server because browser security restrictions prevent loading local files directly with `file://`.

### Recommended: Live Server Extension

1. **Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension** (for VS Code or your preferred editor).
2. Open the project folder in your editor.
3. Right-click on `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
4. The simulation will open in your browser at `http://localhost:PORT`.

## Usage

- **Rotate, zoom, and pan** using your mouse.
- **Pause or resume** the planetary motion with the floating button in the top-right corner.
- **Hover over planets** to see their labels.
- **Resize the browser window** and the simulation will adjust automatically.
