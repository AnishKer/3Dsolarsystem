# 🌌 3D Solar System Simulation

**Explore the universe from your browser!**  
This project brings the Solar System to life with an interactive **3D simulation** using [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/). Watch planets orbit the Sun, zoom through deep space, and experience our cosmic neighborhood with stunning visuals and smooth controls.

## ✨ Features

- 🌞 **Realistic 3D models** of the Sun and all major planets  
- 🌠 **Immersive skybox** for a true deep-space effect  
- 🪐 **Accurate orbital rings** for each planet  
- 🖱️ **Intuitive controls:** rotate, zoom, and pan with ease (powered by OrbitControls)  
- ⏯️ **Play/Pause** planetary motion with a floating button  
- 🏷️ **Dynamic planet labels** that always face you  
- 💍 **Detailed Saturn rings** rendered with multiple concentric meshes  
- 📦 **High-res textures** for every planet and the starry background
